# Project Description: Predicting Fine Particulate Matter Pollution

We introduce the data setting and provide a high-level overview of the most important data science methods for estimating the health risks of air pollution and climate change related exposures. Given the strong evidence that the presence of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere increases mortality and hospitalization rates, it is important that we can track and predict these pollution levels.

One of the main challenges in this work is that the fine particulate matter detectors are sparsely located across the US, meaning that many areas do not have quality data. In this project, you will build a model to predict fine particulate matter pollution in the untracked regions of the US, given data from the tracked areas. This data includes meteorological readings, land use data, and satellite data.

Francesca Dominici is the Clarence James Gamble Professor of Biostatistics, Population and Data Science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Director of the Data Science Initiative at Harvard University.

Dr. Dominici is an international leader at the interface of statistics, data science, causal inference and and public health. Dr. Dominici has stellar leadership in education and mentoring, and the promotion of diversity and gender equality.

Dr. Dominiciâ€™s team has provided the scientific community and policy makers with robust evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution, and climate change. Her studies have directly and routinely impacted air quality policy, leading to more stringent ambient air quality standards in the US.
